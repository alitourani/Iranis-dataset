# Iranian Car License-plates Dataset (IRLP-2020)

This repository contains an Iranian Car License-plates dataset, **IRLP-2020**, for machine learning approaches. The dataset contains hundreds of Iranian car license plate images classified into **different variations** including private cars, public vehicles, gevernmental vehicles, free trade zone vehicles, etc. This dataset contains **realistic condition data** in both challenging and straightforward scenarios and the license plate images have been automatically captured in **various illumination, weather, and noise conditions**. Due to the variety of the images, the dataset is a good option for Deep Learning-based applications.
