# Persian Characters of Car License-plates Dataset (PCLP-2020)

This repository introduces a dataset of Persian characters retrieved from Iranian Car License-plates, named **PCLP-2020**, for machine learning approaches. The dataset contains thousands of Persian car license plate character images classified. This dataset contains **realistic condition data** retrieved from vehicle images in both challenging and straightforward scenarios and the license plate images have been automatically captured in **various illumination, weather, and noise conditions**. Due to the variety of the poses and brightnesses, the dataset is a good option for Deep Learning-based applications.
